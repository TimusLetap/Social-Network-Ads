    "* Ideal client would be small to medium scale ad agency with initial delivery of social network ad campaigns. The factors are minimal in the dataset so this would mean that the client does not have enough metriculated data of users, indicating an early stage of deployment. Building more informed and precise metrics with observations is highly necessary for optimization and improvement. Accurately discerning optimal factors that increase success and likelihood for purchased is the current variable for performance success. "
