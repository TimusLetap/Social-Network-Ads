# Social-Network-Ads
Social network ads are commonly deployed due to their cost effective nature and ease of deployment. In the observed dataset we will observe the use of specific parameters and their predictive probability on purchases. In order to have a successful campaign the parameters need to correlate to purchases as well as be statistically significant. It is important that the ads be deployed more specifically to users that would be more likely to make a purchase than not. We will be analyzing a Kaggle dataset consisting of 400 rows and 5 columns of features. The features are User ID, Gender, Age, Estimated Salary and Purchased. Through exploratory data analysis we will identify the optimum parameters that impact purchase outcomes. The findings from EDA will then be used to build models to see the most optimum fit for ideal results.
We want to understand if there is any apparent observation to the indication of a category of consumers that would benefit the company to deploying ads for a certainty of purchases. This would make the ad more effective and efficient for the company. To generate a certainty of purchases from ad deployment would be highly useful.
